[TradyFit](http://tradyfit.herokuapp.com/) is an application that allows users to sell their sport gear. Potential buyers can search products by key-words and contact the sellers by sending a private message.  

The searches' results will be displayed by nearby location if the user is logged in or by item creation for anonymous users.  

TradyFit is built using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL/PostGIS and Bootstrap as framework.
